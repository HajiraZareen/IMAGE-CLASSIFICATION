# Image Classification System

## Overview
This project demonstrates image classification using TensorFlow on Google Colab. The system trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into different categories. The project is implemented in Python and utilizes TensorFlow's Keras API for building and training the model.

## Features
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** A deep learning model designed for image classification.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Automatic resizing and normalization of images before feeding them into the model.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Model training on a labeled dataset, with evaluation metrics such as accuracy and loss.
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Allows users to input new images and receive predictions from the trained model.
- **Google Colab Integration:** Designed to run efficiently on Google Colab, leveraging GPU acceleration.

## Technologies Used
- **Python üêç**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for building and training the CNN model.
- **Google Colab** for running the project in a cloud environment.
