Image Classification Using TensorFlow - Google Colab
This repository contains an implementation of image classification using TensorFlow in a Google Colab environment. The project demonstrates the steps required to build, train, and evaluate a deep learning model for image classification tasks.

Features
Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load and preprocess images from a dataset.
Model Building: Construct a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras.
Training: Train the CNN model on the preprocessed dataset.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy metrics.
Prediction: Make predictions on new images using the trained model.
Visualization: Visualize training progress and prediction results.
